# Forward-Forward Algorithm (colab friendly)

This is a colab friendly version of &rarr; [this repository](https://github.com/loeweX/Forward-Forward/)

which is a reimplementation of Geoffrey Hinton's Forward-Forward Algorithm in Python/Pytorch.

&rarr; [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345)

&rarr; [Official Matlab Implementation](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/)

There is no conda or hydra used so you can have a better understanding of how the code works in one notebook.

## How to Use
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bghdd/Forward-Forward/blob/main/forward_forward_colab.ipynb) (make sure to change runtime type to GPU)
